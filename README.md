Module 2 Challenge

Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1- The ticker symbol

2- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4 -The total stock volume of the stock.

Bonus 

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

Some assignments, like this one, contain a bonus. It is possible to achieve proficiency for this assignment without completing the bonus, but the bonus is an opportunity to further develop your skills and receive extra points for doing so.
